# 🚦 Crowd Issue Analyzer

## 📌 Overview
**Crowd Issue Analyzer** is a full-stack **MERN-based web application** designed to report, analyze, and manage crowd-related issues in real time.  
The system allows users to submit crowd issues while providing administrators with **actionable analytical insights** to support data-driven decision-making.

This project follows a **single unified architecture**, making it suitable for **real-world deployment**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
In crowded public environments such as campuses, events, and transport hubs:
- Issue reporting is often delayed  
- Problems are poorly prioritized  
- Administrators lack real-time visibility  

This application solves these challenges through **structured reporting, centralized data management, and priority-based issue analysis**.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🔐 User authentication with role-based access  
- 📝 Structured crowd issue reporting  
- ⚡ Priority-based issue categorization  
- 📊 Admin dashboard for monitoring and analytics  
- 🔁 RESTful API-based communication  
- 📱 Responsive and user-friendly interface  
- 🧩 Scalable and maintainable codebase  

---

## 🛠 Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, Postman
