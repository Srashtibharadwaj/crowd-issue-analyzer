# crowd-issue-analyzer
Crowd Issue Analyzer is a full-stack web application that allows users to report public issues (road damage, garbage, water leakage, etc.) with images and location data. The system analyzes and categorizes issues, displays them on a real-time dashboard, and helps authorities track, prioritize, and resolve problems efficiently.
